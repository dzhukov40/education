5) questions
  - [ Tell me about yourself? ]
    - I am from Russia but now live in Berlin.
      I am a Java developer with more than 7 years of experience.
      I have worked on different projects and was responsible for designing 
      and implementing various microservices as part of different information systems.
      I enjoy learning new technologies and new approaches to software development.
      


  - [ What is your biggest weakness? ]
    - I think my main weakness is estimating the time required to complete a task. 
      There are several principles that I try to follow:
        1 breaking the task into smaller components,
        2 separating the parts of the task that depend on other teams 
          or people into separate tasks,
        3 remembering that writing good tests also takes time.
  

  - [ Tell me about a time when you had to solve a complex code problem. ]

  - [ Describe a situation when you had to collaborate with a difficult software engineer. ]
  

  - [ Tell me about a problem and how you overcame it? ]

  - [ Tell me about a time when you had to manage competing deadlines. ]

  - [ Another developer disagrees with your solution and proposes their own? ]
    - If another developer disagrees with my solution and proposes their own, 
      my approach is to stay open-minded and focus on understanding their perspective. 
      I would first listen carefully to their reasoning 
      and ask clarifying questions if needed. 
      My goal is to fully understand the technical rationale behind their suggestion.

      Next, 
      I would compare both approaches by discussing the pros and cons, 
      ideally backed by data or concrete examples. 
      If their solution proves to be more effective or efficient, 
      I’m willing to adapt and go with their idea. 
      On the other hand, if I still believe my solution is better, 
      I would respectfully present my case with supporting arguments.
      
      Ultimately, 
      my priority is not to ‘win’ but to find the best solution for the project 
      and the team. 
      Collaboration is key, 
      and I value open discussions that lead to the best possible outcome.

  - [ Tell me about a time when you failed at work. ]

  - [ Why us? ]
    - I am interested in the field of stock market investments.
      I have a brokerage account and crypto assets.
      I have experience working in the largest banks in Russia.
      I believe Trade Republic is a dynamically developing company with great prospects.
      I might be wrong, but I think your company still retains the spirit of a startup,
        which means incredible flexibility in making technical decisions.
      I see your company as a place where successful solutions 
        and practices can easily spread.

      or disable specific functionality of our application 
      without having to modify code or, ideally, redeploy our app.
