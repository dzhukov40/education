10) GitHub Actions 
  - General:
    - Info: GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform 
            that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
            You can create workflows that run tests whenever you push a change to your repository, 
            or that deploy merged pull requests to production.

    - The components of GitHub Actions
      - "Workflows"
        - A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. 
          Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository 
          and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, 
          or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.
        -...
        - Workflows are defined in the .github/workflows directory in a repository. 
          A repository can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a different set of tasks.
      -...
      - "Events"
        - An event is a specific activity in a repository that triggers a workflow run. 
          For example, an activity can originate from GitHub when someone creates a pull request, 
          opens an issue, or pushes a commit to a repository. 
        - listOfEvents: [ https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows ]
      - "Jobs"
        - A job is a set of steps in a workflow that is executed on the same runner. 
          Each step is either a shell script that will be executed, or an action that will be run. 
          Steps are executed in order and are dependent on each other. 
          Since each step is executed on the same runner, you can share data from one step to another. 
      - "Actions"
        - An action is a custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex 
          but frequently repeated task. 
          Use an action to help reduce the amount of repetitive code that you write in your workflow files. 
          An action can pull your Git repository from GitHub, set up the correct toolchain for your build environment, 
          or set up the authentication to your cloud provider.
      - "Runners"
        - A runner is a server that runs your workflows when they're triggered. 
          Each runner can run a single job at a time. GitHub provides Ubuntu Linux, 
          Microsoft Windows, and macOS runners to run your workflows.
