97) [ Unit 97 ] and   but   or   so   because
  - [A] "and", "but", "or", "so", "because"
    -...
    - We use these words(conjunctions) to join two sentences.
      They make one longer sentence from two shorter sentences:


      sentence A [ The car stopped. ] --- [ The driver got out.] Sentence B
                                       |

                   [ The car stopped "and" the driver got out.]

  -...
  - [B] "and/but/or"

              sentence A            sentence B
     --------------------------------------------------------  
        We stayed at home   "and"   (we)* watched television.

        It's a nice house,  "but"   it doesn't have a garden.
    Do you want to go out,  "or"    are you too tired?
     -------------------------------------------------------
     (*) It is not necessary to repeat 'we' and 'she'.

     - In lists, we use commas (,).
       We use "and" befor the last thing:
       - I got home, had something to eat, 
         sat down in an armchair and fell asleep.
       - Karen is at work, Sue has gone shopping 
         and Cris is playing football.

              Lisa is hungry   "because"   she didn't have breakfast.
        ------------------------------------------------------- 
        -...
        - "Because" is also possible at the beginning:
          - Because it was very hot, I opened the window.

  - [E] In these examples there is more than one conjunction:
    - It was late and I was tired, so I went to bed.

      - /  Helen was 25 when she got married.
